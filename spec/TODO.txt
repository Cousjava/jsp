Subject: schemas in specs

From: Bill Shannon <bill.shannon@sun.com>
To: javaee-specleads@sun.com

My spec has been getting bigger and bigger, largely because I've
been carrying around all the schemas and DTDs for all versions of
Java EE as part of the document.  I polled my expert group and
they generally supported moving the schemas out of the spec document.

What I'm going to do is reference the current and previous schemas
on the web within the main spec document.  I'm also going to prepare
a download bundle that contains the spec document and the current
(but not previous) schema files.

If any of you are including your schemas in your spec documents,
you might want to consider doing the same.
