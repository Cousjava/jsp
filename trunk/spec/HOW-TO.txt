/usr/dist/share/framemaker,v7.0:
open fm/jsp-partioned.book
admin/specgeneration.txt

- Open JSP 1.1
  - manual editing of footer

- Open chapter1
  - view->masterpage
  - dbl click on footer -> all pages footer -> edit definition -> PFD *2*
  - special->variable->book title -> edit definition -> PFD *2*

- Import variable defs from chapter 1 into all other chapters:
  - select all components:
    - click on JSP.1.1
    - go to bottom
    - shift - click
  - file->import->formats->deselect everything except for variables
    make sure I import from chapter1

- Update the var defs in the same way for file apigen/mymifdocletemplate.mif
  e.g., "book title" and "release date" vars
  - when saving, yes on everything

- Import APIs:
  - apigen/apigen.sh
    - REPOS_HOME point to GF home, e.g., REPOS_HOME=/space/luehe/ws/sjsas90
  - make sure apigen/apigen/fm exists before running script

- Add generated *.fm files to book:

  - Location from where to add: /space/luehe/ws/specs/jspspec/apigen/apigen/fm
  - Add API fm files to book by clicking 3rd from left icon at bottom of
    jsp-partitioned.book
  - API fm files to add:
    - javax.servlet.jsp.fm
    - javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.fm
    - javax.servlet.jsp.el.fm
  - If we ever decide to copy generated files into book directory, notice:
    The gif files that are saved in doc-files in the API src directory
    must be copied to be accessible to the generated .fm file
    --> if they are changed, must be copied. Looks like the first gif
        in the tagext API must have its ref updated. Others follow through
        once this one is fixed...
  - Make sure to cvs commit

- Correct problems in javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.fm:

  - Edit -> Find -> Paragraph Tag: "ClassNumbered-1"
    Make sure all the ones that are not supposed to be "1." are changed to
    ClassNumbered-2 instead.  I had to change 4 of them. 
    This is a bug in the MIF converter.  
    Change para tag by clicking paragraph icon (top righthand corner)

  - Find VariableInfo class and fix the table.  
    Select the whole table and resize column widths.  
    Select "By Scaling to Widths Totalling" and set to "6.5".
    Just in case:
    - Change font of inner (white background) cells to be non-bold
      (manually per cell by highlighting cell)
    - TO resize column: select cell (Ctrl- click); shift select the handle
      of the cell

- Change cover page:

  - The background for "Early Draft Release", "Public Review", 
    "Proposed Final Draft".
  - In jsp-partioned.book, dbl-click on JSP_Title.fm
  - View -> Reference Pages
  - Make necessary edits
  - View -> Bodypages (will get me back to cover page)
  - Insert graph by selecting paragraph just above the graph (i.e.,
    "discuss this specification")
     -> paragraph -> designer -> advanced tab
        Frame below pgf -> public / expert / ...

- generate TOC
  -> Click on 2nd from left icon at bottom of jsp-partioned.book
  -> Click on "update" (no other modifs)
     (there are going to be errors about unresolved refs - ignore)
  -> File -> Save book
  -> File -> Save book as -> PDF
     See specgeneration.txt for details, but the following may not be
     required:
   
     o On the Tags tab: Turn off (de-select) Generate Tagged PDF.  I
       don't see where the structure of the tags makes any sense, so I
       suggest turning this off.  Will produce a small file size, too.
   -> to make sure PDF bookmarks are generated, make sure 
      "Genarate PDF bookmarks" has been selected, and choose "All" as the
      level

   -> use "top" utility to see when done
