EDR - 2004.12.08

This announcement was just sent to the J2EE web-tier community.
This is an important milestone. We're making good progress in 
aligning JSP and Faces...

Experts,

Our official announcement about JSP 2.1 and Faces 1.1 EDR.
An important milestone!

[ANNOUNCE] JSP 2.1 and Faces 1.2 Early Draft Review

We're pleased to announce the availability of the Early Draft Review
of the next versions of the specification for JavaServer Pages and
Faces.  JavaServer Pages (JSP) 2.1 is developed under JSR-245 and
JavaServer Faces (Faces) 1.2 is developed under JSR-252.  The two
expert groups are working together to improve the alignment between 
these two powerful web presentation technologies. The foremost such 
alignment issue is the Expression Language, as stated in both JSRs.

JSP 2.1 exports the Expression Language (EL) into its own separate
document; technically a sub-document of the JSP specification.  The
Unified EL spec defines a new top level java package, javax.el.  This
package is completely independent of the technology using it and
allows the using technology to plug itself into the EL resolution
process.  The bulk of the changes in the JSP spec itself follow from
how it uses the Unified EL.

As mentioned in the original JSR-252, this spec is not a new feature
release.  Faces 1.2 contains the work for it to leverage the new
Unified EL, as well as a few spec related bug fixes.

The alignment of Faces and JSP in these JSRs enables some new
capabilities and provides a solid foundation for future growth.  For
example, in a web application that uses both Faces and JSP, it is
possible for pages that only use JSP (without any faces content) to
access managed beans.  Please see Appendix E of the JSP spec and the
preface of the Faces spec to see details of what's changed!

To access the specifications:

   JSP 2.1 EDR (JSR-245)
     http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr245/
   Faces 1.2 EDR (JSR-252)
     http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr252/

Sincerely,

Ed Burns, Pierre Delisle, Roger Kitain, Mark Roth and the JSR-245 and
JSR-252 Expert Groups.

Announcement:

Experts, 

The new unified EL and JSP 2.1 Specifications are now ready 
for review by the Expert Group.

The two spec documents as well as the javadocs have been checked in
the CVS repository of our EG private project at java.net
(https://jsp-spec-eg.dev.java.net/).

Simply click on the download link of revision 1.1 of these files:

   1. EL 2.1 

      Specification (rev 1.1: draft 1 for EDR)
        https://jsp-spec-eg.dev.java.net/source/browse/jsp-spec-eg/spec/ELSpec2.1.pdf

      APIs (javadoc) (rev 1.1: draft 1 for EDR)
        https://jsp-spec-eg.dev.java.net/source/browse/jsp-spec-eg/spec/ELAPI2.1.zip

   2. JSP 2.1 

      Specification (rev 1.1: draft 1 for EDR)
        https://jsp-spec-eg.dev.java.net/source/browse/jsp-spec-eg/spec/JSPSpec2.1.pdf

      APIs (javadoc) (rev 1.1: draft 1 for EDR)
        https://jsp-spec-eg.dev.java.net/source/browse/jsp-spec-eg/spec/JSPAPI2.1.zip

These will be handed off to the JCP for our public Early Draft Review (EDR)
on Friday December 3. We'd really appreciate any review comments by close of business
on Wednesday December 1st, if possible.

To aid in your review, please look at the change log in Appendix E of
the JSP spec. 

The entire Unified EL spec is new, although most of chapter 1 has been
lifted from the JSP 2.0 spec. Section 1.2 is a must read.

Many Thanks,

    -- Pierre & Mark

P.S. To all of you in the U.S., Happy Thanksgiving!

I've included below a draft of an email that we could send to announce
the availability of PR. We could use that same email for both JSF and
JSP.

---
On the JSP side, I would plan to send the announcement
to the following lists:

JSP EG:
  eg@jsp-spec-eg.dev.java.net

JSP spec Public website:
  users@jsp-spec-public.dev.java.net
  announce@jsp-spec-public.dev.java.net
  announce page -> add one entry for the announcement
  update status on home page

Official Forum:
  http://forum.java.sun.com/forum.jspa?forumID=45

Related Lists:
  taglibs-user@jakarta.apache.org
  tomcat-users@jakarta.apache.org

Internal
  kt-org@sun.com (has this changed?)

Please let me know if I am missing any. And I assume
that Jayashri will complement with JSF specific 
lists.

---
For the blog(s), I think it would make more sense to have a single
blog that covers the current state of affairs with PR of
JSP and JSF. I don't think it makes sense to have 2 blogs
to talk essentially about the same thing (although the 2 views
can be different, I think that a common view serves us better
at this point since this is the focus of these 2 JSRs).

Ed, I assume you'd be handling it. If you need help, let me
know. 


Thanks,

    -- Pierre

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] JSP 2.1 and Faces 1.2 Public Review

We are pleased to announce the availability of the Public Review
of the next versions of the specification for JavaServer Pages (JSP)
and JavaServer Faces (Faces).  JSP 2.1 is developed under JSR-245 and
Faces 1.2 is developed under JSR-252.  The two expert groups are working 
ogether to improve the alignment between these two powerful web presentation 
technologies. 

Building on the work that was accomplished with the Early Draft
Review, this Public Review covers two additional areas that required 
better integration between JSP and Faces:

    - Tree Creation and Content Interweaving
    - Deferred expressions nested within iteration tags

Please see Appendix E of the JSP spec and the
Preface of the Faces spec to see details of what's changed.

To access the specifications:

   JSP 2.1 PR (JSR-245)
     http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pr/jsr245/

   Faces 1.2 PR (JSR-252)
     http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pr/jsr252/

Sincerely,

The JSR-245 and JSR-252 Expert Groups
