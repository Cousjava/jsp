problem with headers/footers of the API chapters

import in the API chapter the variables from a regular spec chapter.
Looks like that allows the footer to show, but not the header.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a new release:

Maker Variables
  - All pages footer
  - Book Title
  - JSP_VERSION
  - ... scan the list...

Footer:

The background for "Early Draft Release", "Public Review", 
"Proposed Final Draft".

APIs

Update the template
   View Master Pages
      update BookTitle and ReleaseDate

Generate the javadocs via mifdoclet. 

Simply run apigen/apigen.bat
   Make sure the script points to the proper sources for the
   JSP APIs.
   -> If dzbatcher hangs, make sure the fm/ directory exists
      in apigen/apigen2. (looks like it cannot create it?).

Things to fix after running apigen:


Set the variables in those files (see above)

for javax.servlet.jsp.tagext 

The gif files that are saved in doc-files in the API src directory
must be copied to be accessible to the generated .fm file
  --> if they are changed, must be copied. Looks like the first gif in the tagext API
      must have its ref updated. Others follow through once this one is fixed...

Edit -> Find -> Paragraph Tag: "ClassNumbered-1"
  Make sure all the ones that are not supposed to be "1." are changed to
  ClassNumbered-2 instead.  I had to change 4 of them. 
  This is a bug in the MIF converter.  

Find VariableInfo class and fix the table.  
  Select the whole table and resize column widths.  
  Scale to total 6.5". Change font of inner (white background) 
  cells to be non-bold.
  TO resize column: select cell (Ctrl- click); shift seleect the handle of the cell

Schemas

see admin/xsd.txt

save graphs as jpg 
then impot in the maker document (96 dpi).

[old stuff that does not seem to work
save the vthought file as .eps
open it with photoshop elements -> copy -> paste into the frame document.]

Can save as MIF as well, but was not able to import it though...

gen the TOC
save as PDF
  -> make sure to disable conditional text (only keep the Fix conditional text)

Hi Pierre,

Pat was able to fix your problem with the headers and footers disappearing.  I was able to fix your TOC numbering problem.

To fix the header/footer issue, do the following when you Save As PDF and the dialog called PDF Setup for Selected Files comes up:

o On the Settings Tab:
   -- PDF Job Options: Choose Print or enPrintOptimized (if available)
   -- Page size:  Width-8.5"   Height: 11.0"

o On the Bookmarks Tab:  Keep as is.  Settings are just fine.

o On the Tags tab:  Turn off (de-select) Generate Tagged PDF.  I don't see where the structure of the tags makes any sense, so I suggest turning this off.  Will produce a small file size, too.

o On the Links Tag:  Leave as is.

Another bonus is the the PDF is smaller and it takes less time to generate!

To fix the numbering problem, it's a little more complicated if you're not familiar with reference pages, but here are the steps:

* Open the book and all documents in the book, including the TOC.
* While viewing the TOC document, perform the rest of these steps.
* Position your cursor on javax.servlet.jsp.
* Go to Format-->Paragraphs-->Designer...
   You should see a popup called Paragraph Designer and in the Paragraph Tag menu, you should see PackageHeadTOC.
* On the Basic Tab check the following:
   - First is set to 0.292"
   - Left is set to 1.0"
   - Right is set to 0.0"
   - You have one tab stop set to 4.958"
* When you've confirmed this, click Update All
* Without closing the dialog, position your cursor at ErrorData (right below javax.servlet.jsp)
* No, the Paragraph Tag menu should say ClassHeadTOC.
* Again, on the Basic tab, confirm the following:
   - First is set to 0.625"
   - Left is 1.5"
   - Right is 0.0"
   - You have one tab stop set to 4.958"
* When you've confirmed this, click Update All
* Exit the dialog.
* Save the document.
Now, here's the hard part:
* Make sure the Formatting Bar is viewable (Go to View-->Formatting Bar)
* Go to View-->Reference Pages
* Scroll down to where it says Table of Contents Specification.
* Now, scroll to the definition for ClassHeadTOC.  The menu on the formatting bar should tell you which definition your cursor is on.
* In front of the <$pagenum>, enter <$volnum>- (This will give you the correct numbering. i.e 2-17 or whatever).
* Make sure that there are a string of dots in between <$paratext> and <$volnum>.  If there aren't, position your cursor after <$paratext> and hit the tab key.
* Now, go to the PackageHeadTOC definition.  It should be the third one down.
* Do as you did for the ClassHeadTOC definition.
* Save the document.
* Now, go to the book document.
* Select the top level of the book.
* Go to Edit-->Update Book.
* In the Update Book dialog, select all checkboxes except Apply Master Pages.
* Under the Generate box, make sure your TOC is there.
* Click Update.

If you want, you can call me and I can walk you through it.

Jennifer
